# Project Name
This project is a part of the [Udacity Data Scienist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is for you to show off my technical skills, but more importantly for me to begin putting together a portfolio that shows my ability to effectively communicate technical results.

For this project, I created a [blog post](https://medium.com/@hedejan_27978/a-quick-overview-stack-overflow-2021-survey-results-b31be60ac8b5) and this Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of my own.

Here is an overview of the main steps in this project, following the CRISP-DM process:

* Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.
* Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.
* Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
* Evaluate your results.
* Share your insights with stakeholders in a blog post.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Explanatory Data Analysis

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas/Pandas Profiling
* Numpy
* JupyterLab
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sidetable
* Missingno

## Project Description
For this project, I picked [Stack Overflow Data - 2021 Survey](https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021.zip) dataset. The enclosed data set is the complete, cleaned results of the 2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Using this dataset, I chose 3 questions I aspire to answer from the data. One of the challenges I faced was the fact that each respondent was able to select more than one answer.


## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](https://github.com/hedejan/udacity_DSND_Project_1/tree/main/data) within this repo. There are three files besides this README:

  2. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
  2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
  3. so_survey_2021.pdf - PDF file of the survey instrument
